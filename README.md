# CubeMania

This is my first project on Unity, made it during my apprenticeship in IT.


## How to play
To play it on your PC you will need to:
1. Download all the files in the repository ( README not necessary ).
2. Put them all into a folder.
3. Execute "Cube dash1.exe"
4. And that's it! You're in.

### Gameplay
You are a cube, moving forward, you must get to the end of each level without touching any of the obstacles ( however some obstacle are safe to touch but they are clearly indicated ).
You can use "A" and "D" to move left and right.


## Source
I followed a tutorial to do so, because I had never worked on Unity before.
